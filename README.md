Object Recognition

The lbp_classif.py program must be in the same directory as the set of images provided in the Sakai submission, or with images with the same naming convention.

The program uses a subset of the set of 20 images (10 depicting palm trees, 10 not depicting palm trees) to classify the whole set.
Works by finding the best Kullback-Leibler divergence-based match for each images local binary pattern.
